How to contribute?
==================

Shenfun is an open source project and anyone is welcome to contribute.
An easy way to get started is by suggesting a new enhancement on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun/issues>`_. If you have
found a bug, then either report this on the issue tracker, er even better, make
a fork of the repository, fix the bug and then create a
`pull request <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun/pulls>`_
to get the fix into the master branch.

If you have a particularily interesting application, then we are very interested
in pull requests that are adding new demo programs. If you feel like adding
an extended demo, then have a look at the examples in the
`docs/demos folder <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun/tree/master/docs/demos>`_.
Note that extended demos are written using
`doconce <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/web/index.html>`_.
